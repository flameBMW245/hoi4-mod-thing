Originating in the United Kingdom at the end of the 19th century, social liberalism has spread across much of the western world and formed the foundation for how politics are conducted in dozens of states, functioning as a middle ground for many of the more moderately-minded individuals. Putting the well-being of the economy and corporate sector first and foremost, with the welfare state in a close second, social liberalism tries its hand at juggling the different demands of a healthy economy and a balanced wealth distribution at once."
