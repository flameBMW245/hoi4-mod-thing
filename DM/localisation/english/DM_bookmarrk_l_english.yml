 A_FASCIST_FOE_LOC:0 "Fascism, seemingly a minor ideology created by Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, a sort of third way to divert from Republicanism and Communism, has spread throughout Europe like wild fire. Some have embraced it, through the ballot box or through insurrection, some have prevented it from spreading completely, while others have fallen to the clutches of communism as a way to defeat it altogether. While in the east, Japanese conquest was stopped dead on it's tracks by the Chinese Nationalist-Communist alliance. The fate of European freedom lies not in a broad alliance against fascism, but on the individual decisions of each state, which will determine if fascism shall conquer Europe once and for all, or fall to the annals of history as a disgusting afterthought of a diseased mind. As for Asia, will China prevail and create a stable republic under a hybrid of republican and communist ideals? or will it crumble into a mass of chaos and destroy itself? Will the real slim shady please stand up?"
 GER_DM_DESC_LOC:0 "National Socialism, an ideology that some people say ruined the nation, and others say saved the nation. What can be said about it is plentiful, but we can see the results of it from the effects it had for Germany. Germany lies now, a mess. Occupied by two major powers for 2 decades, and now having to face unification with absolutely no preparation, it finds itself in a tremendously hard situation. Fate shall determine, whether this chained and beaten nation shall once again soar high, as high it did before, or shall it be known as a nation uncontrollable by even it's own government"
